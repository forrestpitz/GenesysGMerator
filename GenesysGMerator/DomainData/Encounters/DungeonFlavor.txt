A rat scuttles past carrying a finger bone with a ring on it.
You hear a card game going on in the next room. It sounds like someone is losing their shirt.
A sleepy orc pushes the party to one side and says "otta ma way cur. Yer blocking the way to the mess hall."
A voice shouts from ahead "My god! What did you do to the loo?"
Blood drips from a hole in the ceiling and pools on the floor.
Your hear the sound of a whip crap from up ahead.
You find a room of corpses. One has a hand outstretched towards a glowing gem. A second has stabbed the first in the back with a dagger.
A paper boat floats past on an underground stream. If plucked from the water is has a letter written inside.
A prisoner in a cage sees the party and yells "turn back! Runaway!"
Cave paintings cover one of the walls, obviously the work of bored hands.
A side corridor has an active trap and deadly trap. A broken treasure chest at the far end spills a few coins.
A grate in the wall allows you to see a mimic finish consuming an adventurer and scuttle off.
Wind howls mournfully as you cross a rope bridge strewn with arrow riddled adventurers.
A hunch back orc with his back to you tinkers with something in the wall and complains loudly about always being the one who has to reset the traps.
A large man sits near a pile of treasure reading a book. If approached he changes to a wisp of smoke and retreats to a lamp. Any amount of rubbing roduces "Go away! We're closed!"
A displacer beast and blink dog come thrashing through a cross corridor.
A dead man's ghost continues searching for a key to a door. A long dead rouge lies nearby.
A grouchy dragon stomps around a vast cave shouting "Igor! Where's the ledger with my gold coins?!" A dusty side corridor holds a tiny, rough made shrine to an unlikely god, and a dusty body it's hands still clasped in prayer.
A hole broken in the brick walls leads to a very, very dark tunnel.
